# First Update (March 13th 2019)

This is my first and probably only update, I've learned the only way to improve the browser cache is to use a CDN.
Cloudflare offers free CDN services but to make it work with github pages I would need to buy A domain name and make Github and Cloudflare work with that.
However I'm not interested in paying for a domain just to have a very fast portfoloio that I don't plan to direct eyes towards for quite awhile.

### What Has Changed?

So since the original post I have deferred the loading for all of my css, I'm using minify to minify all html files and javascript, and using the sass compiler to minify css files on compilation.
